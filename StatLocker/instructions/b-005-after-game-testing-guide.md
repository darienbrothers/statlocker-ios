## üß™ Testing Checklist

### 1. Build the Project
```
Cmd+B to build
```
- The linter errors will resolve once Xcode indexes the new files
- Verify no build errors

### 2. Navigate to After Game Flow
1. Launch app
2. Complete onboarding if not done (or login if existing user)
3. See Dashboard with empty state
4. Tap FAB button (+ button at bottom center)
5. Tap "After Game" option
6. Verify After Game form opens

### 3. Test Goalie Position (Your Current Position)

#### Test Case 1: Valid Game Log
- [x] Select HS context
- [x] Select Conference
- [x] Enter opponent: "Warriors"
- [x] Leave date as today
- [x] Tap + on Shots Faced until value = 15
- [x] Tap + on Saves until value = 11
- [x] Verify Save % displays "73.3%"
- [x] Tap + on Goals Allowed until value = 4
- [x] Tap + on Clears until value = 8
- [x] Tap "Save Game"
- [x] Verify success alert appears
- [x] Tap OK
- [x] Verify you return to Dashboard
- [x] **Verify Dashboard updates:**
  - Should see 1 game in Recent Games
  - Season Goals should update if tracking saves
  - Performance Stats should populate
  - AI Insights should still be hidden (need 3 games)

#### Test Case 2: Validation Warning - Saves > Shots
- [x] Open After Game again
- [x] Enter Shots Faced = 10
- [x] Enter Saves = 12 (invalid!)
- [x] Tap "Save Game"
- [x] Verify warning banner appears with message about saves exceeding shots
- [x] Tap "Fix Stats"
- [x] Adjust Saves to 8
- [x] Tap "Save Game"
- [x] Verify success

#### Test Case 3: Validation Warning - Goals Allowed Mismatch
- [x] Open After Game
- [x] Enter Shots Faced = 12
- [x] Enter Saves = 9
- [x] Enter Goals Allowed = 5 (should be 3)
- [x] Tap "Save Game"
- [x] Verify warning about goals allowed mismatch
- [x] Test both "Fix Stats" and "Save Anyway" options

#### Test Case 4: Club Context (No Conference)
- [x] Open After Game
- [x] Select Club context
- [x] Verify Conference toggle disappears
- [x] Enter stats and save
- [x] Verify saves correctly

#### Test Case 5: Log 3+ Games to Unlock AI
- [x] Log 3 total games (mix of HS/Club)
- [x] Return to Dashboard
- [x] Verify AI Insights card appears with active insight
- [x] Verify it uses appropriate Goalie templates

### 4. Test Context Toggle on Dashboard
- [x] With 3+ games logged (mix of HS and Club)
- [x] Toggle between HS and Club on Dashboard
- [x] Verify Performance Stats update
- [x] Verify Recent Games filter correctly
- [x] Verify AI insights reference correct context

### 5. Test Other Positions (Change Profile Position)

To test other positions, you'll need to either:
- Create a new account with different position
- Manually update your position in Firebase

**Quick positions to test:**
- Attack (should see Goals/Assists/Shots/GBs)
- FOGO (should see Faceoff Wins/Losses)

### 6. Edge Cases
- [x] Tap increment 50 times rapidly (test performance)
- [x] Enter game from 2 weeks ago (test date picker)
- [x] Leave opponent blank (should save without error)
- [x] Tap Cancel (should dismiss without saving)
- [x] Log game, immediately log another (test form reset)

### 7. Debug Log Verification

Check Xcode console for proper debug logs:
```
[StatLocker][Dashboard] FAB sheet presented
[StatLocker][Dashboard] After Game selected
[StatLocker][Logging] AfterGameViewModel initialized for Goalie
[StatLocker][Logging] Incrementing shotsFaced
[StatLocker][Logging] Attempting to save game for Goalie
[StatLocker][GameService] Game saved: {gameId}
[StatLocker][Dashboard] Loaded {N} games for user: {userId}
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Cannot find type 'GameContext'" errors
**Fix:** Just build the project (Cmd+B). These resolve after first build.

### Issue: FAB doesn't appear
**Fix:** Check DashboardView is using ZStack structure and has `FABButton(profile: viewModel.profile)`

### Issue: Games don't appear in Dashboard after save
**Fix:** 
1. Check Firebase console - are games saving?
2. Check `gameService.fetchGames()` is called after save
3. Try pulling down to refresh (if implemented)

### Issue: Validation warnings don't show
**Fix:** Check console logs - validation logic should print warnings

---

## üìä Success Metrics

After testing, you should see:

‚úÖ **3-5 games logged** in Firebase
‚úÖ **Dashboard populated** with real stats
‚úÖ **Performance Stats** showing Save %, Total Saves, etc.
‚úÖ **AI Insights** appear after 3rd game
‚úÖ **Recent Games** list populated
‚úÖ **Season Goals** auto-updating from logged games
‚úÖ **Context toggle** filtering correctly

---

## üéØ Next Steps After Testing

### If Everything Works:
1. ‚úÖ Mark B-005 After Game as complete
2. Move to **B-005 Phase 2: Live Game** (optional - more complex)
3. Or skip to **B-006: Stats Page** (charts, filters, AI insights)
4. Or skip to **B-007: Goals Page** (GoalPace AI, badges)

### If Issues Found:
1. Document the issue
2. Check console logs
3. Share issue details and I'll help fix

## üé¨ Demo Script for Testing

**5-Minute Quick Test:**
```
1. Build project (Cmd+B)
2. Launch app
3. Tap FAB ‚Üí After Game
4. Log 1st game: HS Conference, 15 shots, 11 saves, 4 GA, 8 clears
5. Check Dashboard updates
6. Log 2nd game: Club, 12 shots, 9 saves, 3 GA, 6 clears
7. Check Dashboard
8. Log 3rd game: HS Non-Conf, 18 shots, 14 saves, 4 GA, 10 clears
9. Check Dashboard - AI Insights should appear!
10. Toggle HS/Club - verify stats filter
```

**Expected result:** Dashboard fully populated with stats, insights, and trends after 3 games logged.
